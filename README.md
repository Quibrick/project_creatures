# project_creatures
Core idea for a Turn-Based Pokemon-like RPG 

As of now I have created the constructors for the Object Creatures( The playable objects ) and the Object Trainer ( Player's character - non playable ).

There are some tested methods on Combat, Inventory managment, XP gain ( early implementation ) , some to_string methods.

This project was my introduction in Object Oriented Programming .
