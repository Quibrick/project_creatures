Core idea for a Turn-Based Pokemon-like RPG 

As of now I have created the constructors for the Object Creatures( The playable objects ) and the Object Trainer ( Player's character - non playable ).

There are some tested methods on Combat, Inventory managment, XP gain ( early implementation ), a randomizer to create a pool of enemies and more.

There are 4 main categories ( Fire , Water , Rock , Grass ). Based on these we calculate the Attack Points (AP) that one creature inflicts to another.

There is an initializer for the game ( Set your character's name, your creature's name, choose your creature's type ). 

Theoretically you can take all the core, implement a basic game loop and create a bare-bones RPG game.


This project was my introduction in Object Oriented Programming .
